Improves TMDL readability with context-aware syntax coloring

# Code Formatting
![Code Formatting](./images/Codeformatting.gif)
Automatically organizes TMDL code for enhanced readability and consistency along with enhanced formatting for embedded Power Query within TMDL with soon integration of DAX query formatting.

# Error Diagnostics
![Diagnostics](./images/Diagnostics.gif)
Identifies and highlights errors in TMDL code directly within the editor.
Also detects syntax issues in embedded Power Query, with DAX diagnostics support on the way.
Error messages are shown in the user's language based on locale settings.

> **Note:** Users must update their `locale` setting separately for Power Query in the VS Code extension to enable localization.

# Autocomplete
![Autocomplete](./images/Autocomplete.gif)
Provides smart, context-aware suggestions while editing TMDL documents.
Autocomplete support also includes embedded Power Query, and will soon expand to include DAX queries.
# Hover Information
![Hover Information](./images/HoverProvider.gif)
Displays helpful contextual information when hovering over elements in TMDL documents.
Supports both TMDL and embedded Power Query, with future plans to support DAX as well.
# Code Actions
![Code Actions](./images/CodeActions.gif)
Offers quick fixes and refactoring suggestions for common TMDL issues. Examples include:
  1. Resolving duplicated lineage tags
  2. Correcting misspelled properties
  3. Adding missing syntax elements like colons, quotes, equal signs, etc.
And many more helpful fixes.
# Breadcrumbs
![Breadcrumbs](./images/Breadcrumbs.gif)
